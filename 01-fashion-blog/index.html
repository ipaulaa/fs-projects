          can be both amazingly fun & incredibly overwhelming, especially if
          you've never been. Luckily, I'm here to give you an insider's guide
          and make your first show a pleasurable experience. By taking my tips
          and tricks, and following your gut, you'll have an unforgettable
          experience!

        <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

          If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price
          tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here
          to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you
          and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If you're
          worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't have fun.
          Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers
          you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!

          Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be
          uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about
          expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to
          express through their new lines. Also it's important to wear shoes
          you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but
          you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
